Babel:
    It is a javascript compiler which converts code written in newer version into a format that older browsers understand.
Ex:
new version code:
// ES6 code
const greet = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('Rashmika');

transpiled code by babel:
// Transpiled ES5 code
'use strict';

var greet = function greet(name) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + name + '!');
};

greet('Rashmika');
Some new features that most developers use everyday but not supported by older browsers are: Arrow functions, classses, let &
const, template literals, spread syntax, promises, modules etc
